Ok if your looking to help but not sure where to start here is my todo list,,, if i ever get to it

1 smoth out the spool motor, right now it simply turns on and off and that really limits how fast 
we can go without missing stepps. Since it is turned on and of via a threshold of a variable resistor we could turn it on progresivly 

2 if the spool motor stays on for more than say a certain number of loops than it canot keep up with the coil
mottor... reduce coil motor speed 

3 Need to post a scithmatic of the hardware. 

4. add way more real time ouput of more info like:
-meeters of wire on coil
-resistance on coil( already done but could printed more often than detected)
-number of turns on coil 
-voltage requred for given amprage 
-amprage of coil at given voltage. 

5 design auto glue despenser ... think supper small container below tentioner pully 
with a hole in it ... wire goes thru glue, then throug hole with a very thin bit of glue on it. 

6. Draft up phisical body of winder, to be cut out with laser cutter or cnc router. 
 
7. Document asembly of winder

8. add 3rd stepper that guides wire back and forth to spool it on to the coil evenly
- code so that given wire gage it knows how far to move over each turn 
- code so that given coil mold width it knows how far to go across the coil. 


9. stop and drink a beer ...... while Winder makes coils
