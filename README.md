winder
======

A machine that automatically winds copper coils to exact specifications.

There are lots of diy coil winders out there but this one is a bit differnt. 

Origanaly built and coded by Rylan Grayston for the peachy printer project 
which reqired the winding of very fine (50 gage wire). Being that the wire is so fine that one canot simply pull on it to un spool it as doing so would break it. The soluiton is to motorize both the winding of the coil and the unwinding of the spool. The motor speed must be turned at dynamicly adjusting rates as to not break the very fine wire (finer than hair). 
tension is with a hanging mass and is very constant. The speed of the spool is governed by a variable resisror which senses when more wire is needed.

another two variable resistors control the global speed of the hole wining proses and the max speed of the spool coil. 

How to use it:

enter in the wire gage your using and the desired resistance of your coil 
then run the script, the script will cause the winder machine to automaticly make the coil, once compleet the script will print out all the info that it knows about the coil including how many turns are in it!

Winder looks pretty ugly right now.. but it works great!!!
